🧮 Scholar Calculator — Lesson 1 Project
📘 Description

The Scholar Calculator is my first Python project under the AI & Machine Learning Mastery Roadmap (Phase 1).
It’s a simple yet powerful calculator program that performs basic mathematical operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — written entirely in Python.

This project helped me understand core Python concepts such as:

Input and output functions

Arithmetic operators

Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

Basic function structure

🚀 Features

✅ Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
✅ User-friendly interface through the terminal
✅ Error handling for invalid inputs
✅ Fully written in pure Python (no external libraries)

🧠 Lessons Learned

From this project, I learned how to:

Use functions to structure Python code

Handle user inputs and validation

Write clean and readable code in VS Code

Use Git and GitHub for version control and pushing projects

🧩 Technologies Used

Language: Python 3.13.9

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Version Control: Git

Hosting: GitHub

🛠️ How to Run the Project
Step 1 — Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Yussuf919/Scholar-Calculator-AI-ML-Project-1.git

Step 2 — Run the script
python scholar_calculator.py

📈 Project Status

✅ Completed Lesson 1
🚧 Continuing to Lesson 1 Part 2 — Python Essentials & Control Flow
